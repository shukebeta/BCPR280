<td colspan="2">
  <b>In this iteration, my goal is to implement a simple game of guessing a secret number. It is simple, but it is also fun, so it is worthwhile as a iteration.
 </b>
  <ol>
    <li>The program shall generate a random number between 0 and 99.</li> 
		<li>The USER can input his / her guess.</li>
		<li>The program shall response with "Try higher", "Try lower" or 
    <li>If the guess is correct, the program shall response with "You got it in n trials". </li>
