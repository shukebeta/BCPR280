## Goal of Iteration

<td colspan="2">
  <b>In this iteration, my goal is to implement a more complex game to let Computer guessing a secret number in my mind. It is the most complex Guessing number game, and it is more fun, so it is worthwhile as a iteration.
 </b>
  <ol>
    <li>The USER mentally selects a number between 0 and 99, and the Computer tries to guess it.</li> 
		<li>The Computer outputs its guess,</li>
		<li>and the USER shall response with "COLD" if the guess is more than or equal 40 from the target number</li>
		<li>the USER shall response with "COOL" if the guess is within 20-39 of the target number</li>
		<li>the USER shall response with “WARM” if the guess is within 10-19 of the target number</li>
    <li>the USER shall response with “HOT” if the guess is within 1-9 of the target number</li>
    <li>If the guess is correct, the USER shall response with "correct". </li>
    <li>If the User lies, the Computer should complain. </li>
  </ol>

	METHOD(How is the goal met? Which artefact, validation technique and test group are used? For instance, paper prototype, spike, shippable product increment; product demo, usability test, A/B test; users, customers and/or internal stakeholders.)

<td colspan="2">
A single page application for this game will be the final product. It should be run well in all modern browsers.

Metrics(How do you determine if the goal has been met? For instance, at least three of the ﬁve testers carry out the usability test successfully in less than a minute.)

Five classmates will be invited to test this application. All of them should complete a game successfully in 5 minutes.
