# Restful api for calculate Correlation & Linear Regression

## Service Running Port

Once you started this serivce, it is running on portï¼š **8964**.

## Start service

In fact, I have written two service for the restful api task. The first approach used the "Express" package, the other approach used the http package, which Dr Luofeng Xu told us that we should use it.

Using 

    npm start 
    
to start the "Express" version, or using
    
    ./httpserver.js
    
to start the "http" package version. The function of two approach is identical, so the User Interface is the same one, which is located in the htdocs folder.
    
## Stop service

### /api/get-correlation

- request method: **GET/POST**
- must have **parameters**:
  - listx: comma or space separated number list, such as "83, 116, 186, 81, 114"

- **good** parameter show be:
  - the count of numbers from listx and list y must be equal
  - the count of numbers should greater than 0
- **return** value: a JSON string will be returned.
  - satisfied return: `{
       "success": "true",
       "correlation": 0.8312640410860297
